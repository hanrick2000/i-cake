# Depth first search (DFS) and traversal notes

**Depth First Search** = method to explore a tree or graph by examining entire paths before backing up to try other paths

**Pros and Cons**
Pros:
- DFS on binary trees usually requires less memory than BFS
- DFS is easily implemented using recusion

Cons:
- Using DFS does not always find the shortest path to a node, unlike BFS
