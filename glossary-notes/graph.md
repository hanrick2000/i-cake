# Graph Notes

**graph** = data structure with nodes (vertices) connected by edges.  Graphs
are useful at representing things that connect to other things
- cities and highways
- routers and cables
- facebook users and their friendships

Two nodes connected by an edge are **adjacent** or **neighbors**
