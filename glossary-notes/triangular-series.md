# Triangular Series Notes

**Triangular Series** = series of numbers where numbers could represent the
"width" of a row of an equilateral triangle

ie: 1, 2, 3

    X
   X X
  X X X

**Triangular Number** = sum of a triangular series (ie: 6 for a series of [1,2,3])

A triangular series always starts with 1, and increases by 1 with each number.  Thus, they can be represented by their largest value, *n*

For every triangular series,
1. The pairs of numbers on each side of the triangle always sum to the same value
2. The value of the sum is always *n+1*

`Total sum = (n+1) * n/2 = (n^2 + n) / 2`
