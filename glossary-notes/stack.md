# Stacks

**stacks** = data structure that is last-in, first out (LIFO), ie: like a
stack of books.  The item that was put in most recently must also come out
first

Stacks have two primary methods:
1. `push()` = add an item
2. `pop()` = remove and return the top item

Stacks may also have some helper methods:
3. `peek()` = return the item on the top of the stack without removing it
4. `is_empty()` = return `True` if stack is empty, else `False`
