# Breadth First Search (BFS) & Traversal

**Breadth-first search (BFS)** = method for exploring a tree or graph by starting with all of the closest nodes, then the next closest, and so on

**Pros and Cons**
Pros:
- BFS finds the shortest path between starting point and any other reachable node, where a DFS will not always find the shortest path

Cons:
- Using BFS on a binary tree *usually* requires more memory to implement than a DFS
