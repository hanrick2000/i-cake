# Binary Search Notes

**Binary Search** = algorithm that searches a sorted array in O(lg(n)) time

1. Start with middle number: is it bigger or smaller than the target number?
2. This divides the problem in half
3. Repeat by starting in the middle of the new halves each time until the number is found or the entire set has been searched

Can be done recursively or iteratively
